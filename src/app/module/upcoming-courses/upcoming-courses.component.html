                    <p style="color:#232323;">The course is suitable for those who are able to seriously commit to working deeply with Dr. Kumar, demonstrating the highest level of discipline, dedication and devotion to the teacher, the lineage of Yoga and the teachings. Previous experience is not a requirement.
                      This course is an opportunity for deep, holistic, and experiential learning, grounded in the purest traditions and lineages, underpinned by profound explanations of the science of body and mind. 
                      The course will be a wonderful journey for those who are seeking authentic knowledge and will be rigorous and challenging in order to make maximum progress. We welcome you to join no matter what stage you are at in your journey.
                      Suitability is based on agreement to uphold the strict code of discipline based on the Course Ethos below.
                      </p>
      
                    <h5 style="color:#232323;"><b>Course Ethos</b></h5>
      
                    <p style="color:#232323;"><b>1. Work hard without expectation/ Nishkaama Karma Yoga and Karmaphala Sanyasa Yoga:</b> The fundamental yogic principle to stay happy is to have ZERO expectation, so that anything thus given gives complete satisfaction, happiness and gratitude. Do not come with any preconceived notions of what ‘should’ be taught. If what you expect is to be taught, then why is a Guru or tradition required? 
                      This amounts to not learning. Dr. Kumar will teach what we need to become Yogis as per the traditions, not what we think we need or want. A Karma Yogi appreciates and has gratitude for everything they receive and accepts challenges smilingly.</p>
                      <p style="color:#232323;"> <b>2. Live in the present</b> with an open mind, accepting each moment of the teaching as it comes. This will enable you to get maximum benefit from the spontaneous and dynamic way in with Dr. Kumar teaches. A Guru is a clean water pipe through which the water of the teachings flow, don’t look for a set package or timetable of teaching that would block that flow, just drink the water and trust that it will nourish and purify you. Yoga is to live in this moment, accept and adapt, instead of having any expectation about this moment. Because this moment is not created by you or for you but for everyone. Like any other species, instead of questioning what is given in this moment and becoming unhappy, the best way is to accept it. </p>
                      
                        <p style="color:#232323;"> <b>3. Surrender to the Guru/ Bhakthi Yoga:</b> Surrender is your strength and protection on the path to enlightenment. Take refuge in the Guru. Don’t question or argue with the Guru mentally. Whatever is not understood just leave it be, don’t react. Learn to listen without bringing the filter of subjective interpretation based on past conditioning. Just absorb without putting an intellectual filter of preconceptions and previously learned notions. 
                      
                      In order to learn we must unlearn and relearn. As Shankaracharya says, once you have used right discernment to choose an enlightened teacher, then that is it. What the Guru teaches should not be questioned. The student is at the lotus feet of the Guru. If you trust your own perception more than the Guru’s teaching, then why go to a teacher in the first place? This is ingrained in the traditions. Respecting the authority of the Guru is central to the path and if one is not comfortable with this, the course is not for you. 
                      
                    </p><p style="color:#232323;"><b> 4. Inflammatory response is required for growth. Tarka/Vitarka:</b> A true Guru is not a pleaser or pamperer and is prepared to shake us out of our conditioning even though it is very difficult. A much easier option for a Guru is to only say what we like and avoid saying thing that we don’t like, but with this approach we would never progress.  A Guru shouts and admonishes us in order to bring deep change and clear our karma, this is sometimes called ‘tough love’. Be prepared to go out of your comfort zone. 
                      
                      The path to enlightenment takes courage, faith, resilience, and dedication. If something being taught triggers a strong emotion in you, that is an opportunity to observe the reaction and learn more about your own unconscious habit patterns. If something has triggered you (perhaps because it challenges your prior learning, perceptions, cultural values, or views) don’t create a conflict in your mind or dwell on it, just think ‘I don’t yet understand this’. Live in the present and stay open-minded. A Yogi has a 360 perspective, far greater insight and sees the subtleties of reality that we miss. If a lesson is being taught it has a purpose and a context, it is our job to understand the purpose of the lesson. 
                      
                    </p> <p style="color:#232323;"><b>5. Be patient / Sahana and Samyama:</b>If you don’t understand something be patient because learning deeply is like slow cooking, the results are nutritious and tasty. Don’t look for fast food.  If you have specific theoretical questions try to wait, you may find they are answered in another class, or you may realise that they are no longer important or necessary. 
                      
                      Stay calm and quiet and reflect on whether it is really a worthwhile practical question or just a conceptual one. If it is a valid question, you can ask a course volunteer, or if you just want to reach out and connect with a volunteer for a chat that’s fine too. 
                      
                    </p> <p style="color:#232323;"><b>6.Have humility/Aham Brahmasi:</b> Traditional yoga is a charity: The teaching and the entire course is being given freely and generously by Dr Kumar, supported by volunteers, and what is being given is immeasurable. Please do not ask for more or extra than what is freely given. 
                      
                      Please value the time of the volunteers and remember that you are a student not a customer. Please bear with any technical glitches or other course issues that arise, everyone is working very hard to ensure things go smoothly but this can never be 100% guaranteed. 
                      
                    </p> <p style="color:#232323;"><b>7. Practice with awareness/ Sati/Sadhana /Abhyasa.</b> Please approach your practice with awareness of your individual physical limits and go at a pace that is appropriate for you. Practice meditation as per the course guidelines and if you need help let a volunteer know. If you experience any insomnia let a volunteer know immediately.

                    <p style="color:#232323;">All courses are conducted in Purvashrama Sampradaya, the traditional system of Guru Shishya Parampara of Shrutha Sampradaya, which means the oral tradition, ‘as heard from Gurus.’ Every word spoken by Dr Kumar, honors the pure lineages which he graciously represents in absolute gratitude and reverence.</p>
      
                    <p style="color:#232323;">Students on any of the online courses are entering into a virtual ashram and should be prepared to conduct themselves with utmost caution, discipline and awareness.</p>
      
                    <p style="color:#232323;">When one enters the gates of an ashram, they must leave their intellectual baggage and prior learning at the door regardless of qualifications, experience or status, and enter in humility, as a beginner, an empty cup ready to be filled with the purest of pure teachings.</p>
      
                    <p style="color:#232323;">The path to enlightenment can only be taught by one who has achieved it. Going to such a Guru should only be undertaken if one is able to surrender one’s own perceptions and judgments and to understand that everything being taught is necessary for the goal to be achieved. What is taught comes direct from the Pool of Consciousness exactly as it should be in order for us to break out of the bondages of our conditioning.</p>
      
                    <p style="color:#232323;">In every traditional ashram in India, the student is at the lotus feet of the Guru in unquestioning devotion and surrender. The Guru is a representative of the Pool of Consciousness and a conduit to Singularity/ Holy Spirit/ Parabrahma/Paramatma/ Allah/ Non-Entropy and the way to connect is through the grace of the Guru’s teaching and voice.</p>
      
                     <p style="color:#232323;">These courses are not for those who learn from the head, approach the courses as an intellectual pursuit, or consider it their right to critically evaluate, judge or take a position of agreement or disagreement on the teachings, as one might do in other educational contexts. Neither is it correct to learn conditionally, partially or on one’s own terms. The only way to learn in such a setting is unconditionally, non-judgmentally and choicelessly, to learn from the heart not from the head, and to establish a sense of connectedness to the Guru so that what flows through him can flow through you.</p>
      
                    <p style="color:#232323;">An enlightened Guru is a super-conductor. Any positive conduct as a student under such a Guru is like planting a mango seed in fertile ground that will bear hundreds of sweet fruits, however, any negative conduct is like planting a bitter seed in fertile ground that will bear hundreds of poisonous fruit. This is the reason why the Code of Discipline & Joining Agreement is strictly enforced in any ashram in which the technologies of enlightenment are being taught, it is for the protection of the student, the protection of the community and the protection of the traditions.</p>

                    <p style="color:#232323;">As a student, what is important is to have the right intention, the right attitude and the right devotion in order to benefit from this rare and precious opportunity. The teachings of Yoga do not exist without enlightened teachers to convey them and the student-teacher relationship (Sanskrit: Guru Shishya Parampada) is everything. Even though the course is online this is still very relevant as consciousness has no barriers. 
                      </p><p style="color:#232323;">The attitude of a student is of paramount importance when taking a course of this nature. This is for your own benefit and in respect for the Guru and great lineage of enlightened teachers who have preserved these teachings.
                      </p><p style="color:#232323;">These courses are for those aspiring to follow the highest path of Yoga, who wish to make a soul journey under the expert guidance of an accomplished and fully enlightened Guru. The aim is to become completely selfless, thereby liberating the soul from the ego. 
                      </p><p style="color:#232323;">To become a student of such a teacher is a great privilege and an incredibly rare opportunity, the criteria to join is not payment, but suitability based on the attributes of a student outlined by the great Indian Saints and Gurus of the Yoga tradition.
                      </p><p style="color:#232323;">The opportunity is to learn Yoga within its authentic Indian cultural context.  In the Indian system a Guru teaches not just techniques but guides one on every single aspect of life, teaching us how to live in purity for the perfect health and happiness of the individual and for the rebalancing society as a whole.
                      </p><p style="color:#232323;"> Although courses last a few months, the tradition of going to learn with a Guru is to find a guide for a lifetime because this journey is not easy or immediate. Deep transformation takes dedication, perseverance and a burning desire to pursue the path. As long as Dr. Kumar is willing to teach, students who uphold the code of conduct can continue their journey with him on an ongoing basis.
                      </p><p style="color:#232323;">The courses follow the strict ethos of the lineages and traditions of the noble ones, the Yogis. This is in order to uphold the sanctity, purity and undiluted teachings of those Yogis who selflessly sacrificed their secrets of practice and path, in absolute trust, in order to benefit their devoted students.
                      </p><p style="color:#232323;">What will be taught is the highest science given by enlightened Yogis, not by those who are still seekers or teachers at the stage of exploring mind and body having not yet attained full liberation. The course will teach the pure technique of Self Realisation (Sanskrit: Siddhantha Vicharana / Vidya Paddhathi) as practiced and realised by every Yogi and Saint in India for thousands of years, such as the great Nachiketa, Brigu, Yagnavalkya, Vasista, Vyasa, Krishna, Buddha, Patanjali, Adi Shankara, Jesus, Guru Nanak, Mohammad Prophet.
                       
                      </p><p style="color:#232323;">The following are the expected qualities of a student (Shadguna) as given by Adi Shankaracharya and other important points.
                       </p>
                       <ul>
                          <li>Damamu: Not becoming distracted</li>
                            <li>Shamamu: The ability to focus</li>
                            <li>Uparathi: The ability to sustain concentration</li>
                            <li> Titiksha: The ability to avoid reacting</li>
                            <li> Shraddha: Total surrender, self-motivation, devotion and interest</li>
                            <li>Samadhana or Gratitude:  The development of humility, ego-lessness and selflessness</li>
                            <li>Also, Mumuksha: The burning desire to become enlightened. The realisation of Allah, the Holy Spirit, Paramatma, requires perseverance in spiritual progress.

                    <p style="color:#232323;">Learn the most ancient science of Yoga for holistic healing through Asana, Pranayama, Mudra, Bhandana, Dharana, Dhyana and Yoga Kaya Chikitsa (Masso Therapy). This course will be immensely useful for all types of people including therapists, physiotherapists, ayurveda therapists of pancha karma, yoga teachers, sport and exercise coaches, fitness trainers, traditional healers, doctors, and for people in general.

                      </p><p style="color:#232323;">Yoga Masso Therapy is a solution for all muscular, skeletal, digestive, respiratory, reproductive, and nervous system related problems. This is one of the rarest opportunities for anyone to learn such a system which has hitherto been unavailable in any prevailing traditions of yoga. 
                      
                      </p><p style="color:#232323;">The course covers the progressive stages of purification, working at all levels: physical, cellular, and with the conscious, subconscious and unconscious mind. As a student you will work with the physical body through asana and with Vedic science through the application of Yoga Kaya Chikitsa i.e., Yoga Kaya Samvahana (physical manipulations) and Yoga Kaya Samvadana (oil manipulations). Students will work on the subtle cellular body with pranayama practice, and on purifying the mind through correct practice of meditation which deconditions mind of its accumulated impurities and by cultivating discernment about different techniques of meditation and their effects. The course also covers nutritional aspects of therapeutic nutrition and performance nutrition for recovery of both therapist and patient. Learning these techniques under an enlightened guru has a positive ripple effect on all aspects of life. This course will teach you to be selfless and egoless.
                      
                      </p><p style="color:#232323;">What is not suitable for a healer, therapist or doctor is ego. To be able to teach or heal, firstly, you need to heal yourself and then you can heal others. If you heal others with ego, when you touch them, what will you be transferring to them? You need to come to the level of a ‘super conductor’ where you can remove others’ heat and impurities without absorbing anything from them. A Yogi is called a super conductor. A Yogi does not boast of qualifications, but works selflessly like a Jesus, a Prophet, Buddha, Patanjali, Brihaspati, Dhanvantari or Socrates who never claimed anything. Boasting about your PhDs and other qualifications is ego, making you ineligible to be a healer or a therapist.
                      
                      </p><p style="color:#232323;">Wisdom is understanding that the cause of unhappiness is a delusion, worshipping taste, ego, finding happiness in your taste, in ego, is a slow poisoning. This is the cause of every disease, every suffering. We must learn to shun the ego mercilessly, shun our taste mercilessly. No-one who worships these will ever be happy. A yogi is a super-conductor who makes your entropy zero. For soul seekers, the entire world is their family. Every movement is to achieve highest level of conductance. This is the eligibility to be a healer.
                      
                      </p><p style="color:#232323;">Therapy is a Sanskrit word. “Tera” means noble/enlightened person and “Apy” means the one who removes the heat by throwing water on the fire. All teachers under the Buddha are called Teras. Tera means the one who has become completely selfless and a noble person. There is no ego. Tera also means it is all yours and nothing is mine. Whatever you eat, wear, etc., is not yours, so why hold onto pride? You are dependent on everyone for your living. How can you be great? The one who is making you survive is the greatest.
                      
                      </p><p style="color:#232323;">Such techniques should be administered as learnt from a Yogi, who programmed their 73 trillion cells to conserve oxygen (prana), and who aimed to become a human with unconditional love, selflessness, attitude of generosity, feeling of giving off everything, the wish to serve others and sprouting positive qualities – How can I serve? How can I give away everything? Even if I give away everything, it is nothing compared to what these lineages have given me.
                      
                       
                      
                      </p><p style="color:#232323;">The course covers therapeutic, restorative and rejuvenating techniques of yoga. This course is for serious aspirants who look for transformation, purification and liberation of the body, mind, and soul under the expert guidance of an accomplished and fully enlightened Guru. The course follows the strict ethos of the lineages and traditions of Indian Vedic Ashrams.
                      
                      </p><p style="color:#232323;">Not only professional therapists but all family members of an ordinary aspirant can benefit from the program as these advanced therapy techniques can help their spouse, children, and parents keep all ailments away. Even if administered once a week, this advanced therapy can provide a single remedy for all kinds of maladies that modern lifestyles expose you to.
                      
                       
                      
                      </p><p style="color:#232323;">Offered by Yoga Healing Foundation on a voluntary donation basis for students who fulfil the course criteria.
